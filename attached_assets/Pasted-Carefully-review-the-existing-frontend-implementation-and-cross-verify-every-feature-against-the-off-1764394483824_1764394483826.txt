Carefully review the existing frontend implementation and cross-verify every feature against the official Greenfield Radar specification.
Use the uploaded document titled “Greenfield Radar.docx” as the base specification. 

Greenfield Radar


Also reference the micro-tile scoring visuals and UI behavior shown in the uploaded PDF. 

Location_Scoring_Decisive_Insig…

This is a frontend-only validation.
Ignore backend/scoring logic — focus ONLY on UI, map behavior, and user interaction.

✅ 1. Verify All Required UI Components Exist

Cross-check that all components required by the project spec are present and implemented:

A. INPUT PANEL (Left Sidebar)

The document requires the frontend to support:

Search bar (address input)

Drop pin / choose location

Transport mode (Walking / Driving)

Time Budget slider

Business Category selector (“Coffee Shop”, etc.)

Priority sliders:

Competition

Footfall

Amenities

Version label (v1.0.0 or similar)

Verify if all these exist & work.
Check design consistency with spec and image.

✅ 2. Map System Verification

Verify the map behaves EXACTLY as required in the document.

The frontend must have:

A. Map Rendering

MapLibre GL map

OpenMapTiles vector tiles as basemap

Smooth panning & zoom

B. Catchment Visualization

Isochrone shape OR radius area (blue outline as shown)

Transparent fill

C. POI Icons

POIs for competitors, amenities, transit must appear on the map exactly like the spec indicates.

D. Dynamic Layers

Verify layers exist for:

Heatmap (tile intensity visualization)

Tile outlines

Top 3 tile highlights

POI markers

User pin

E. Interactivity

Hover on tile → show score preview

Click on map → update selected location

Map adjusts automatically after scoring

✅ 3. Score Panel Verification (Right Side Panel)

Verify the right-hand LOCATION SCORE panel matches the spec.

It should include:

Total Location Score (0–100)

Top 3 micro-tiles with scores

Colors similar to official design

“Compare Location” button

Download / export icon

The document explicitly shows these elements.
Cross-check against the uploaded screenshot you provided.

✅ 4. PRIORITY SLIDER SYSTEM CHECK

The doc requires that priority sliders adjust scoring weights.

Frontend must have:

Competition slider

Footfall slider

Amenities slider

Check:

Sliders visually exist

They send correct values to backend

UI updates live

Values are displayed clearly (e.g., 77%)

✅ 5. Compare Mode Verification

Document requires:

A mode to compare two locations

Button “Compare Location”

Dual heatmap or side-by-side view

Verify:

The button exists

Compare-mode UI is implemented

Compare panel layout is correct

Compare interaction flow works

If compare mode is missing, flag it.

✅ 6. Feature-by-Feature Cross-Verification with the Official Spec

Go through each requirement from the uploaded project document and confirm if the frontend meets it:

MVP Requirements (as per doc) 

Greenfield Radar

Map UI + ability to drop pin

Isochrone or radius catchment

Display nearby POIs

Competitor heatmap

Micro-tile scoring visualization

Top 3 tiles visible

Summary card with reasons

Verify each one individually.

✅ 7. Heatmap Behavior Verification

Based on the micro-tile scoring PDF, verify:

Heatmap intensity correlates with tile scores

Gradient matches system design (green → red)

Tiles reflect micro-grid scoring

Top tile visually highlighted

Use the example visual reference from page 6–9. 

Location_Scoring_Decisive_Insig…

✅ 8. UI Style & Layout Audit

Verify that the frontend follows these styling rules from the document:

Clean dark sidebar

Bright, high-contrast map

Modern minimal card components

Smooth transitions

Rounded corners

Proper spacing and typography hierarchy

This matches the visual language shown in your screenshot.

✅ 9. Error Handling Verification

Verify the frontend correctly handles:

Invalid address

No POIs found

API timeout

Empty score results

Map load failure

Slider error states

If missing, mark as TODO.

✅ 10. Upgrade Readiness Check

The agent must evaluate whether the architecture is modular and ready for future upgrades such as:

Multi-layer toggles (competition, footfall, amenity heatmaps)

Persona scoring tags

Historical POI caching

Camera-based street scanning UI

Multi-location comparison

PDF export visualization

Flag any parts of the UI structure that may block future upgrades.
